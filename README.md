# Project05-Map

For this project I integrated both the Facebook and Foursquare (Venue/Explore) APIs. This application allows the user to search for local venues in the Phoenix Metropolitan area.

A Google map displays on screen with centered on my neighborhood (Chandler AZ). The user has the ability to search for a local venue such as an event or restaurant. The user also has the ability to share and like on Facebook. The page will then display images of people who have liked on Facebook.

How to use application:
1. This application uses Google's HTML 5 Geolocation feature.

2. Click on index.html to launch the application.

3. If map displays blank when page loads, enable geolocation in your browser window by clicking on the geolocation icon in the address bar. After geolocation has been enabled, the map will load with a marker indicating your current location.

4. Enter a search paramter such as 'McDonalds' and click the blue Submit button.

5. A list will display on the left side of the map providing information on matching venues. Additionally, markers will display at each venue location on the map.

6. Hover over marker to display the name of venue at each location.

7. Log into your Facebook account to Share and Like.
